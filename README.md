# ⚖️ Silent Auction Program

Welcome to the **Silent Auction Program** — 
a fun and interactive Python project where users can secretly place their bids, and the system automatically determines the **highest bidder**. This project is a great way to learn about **functions, loops, and dictionaries** in Python while keeping things simple and engaging.

## 🪙 Features

- 🎨 Beautiful **ASCII Gavel Logo** displayed at startup  
- 💰 **Multiple bidders** can enter their names and bid amounts  
- 🧠 **Smart comparison logic** to find the highest bid automatically  
- 🔁 Option to **continue bidding** until no participants remain  
- 🧾 Clean and easy-to-understand **Python code structure**  
- ⚙️ Demonstrates **dictionary manipulation**, **loops**, and **functions**

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program displays a **gavel logo** (from `art.py`) when it starts.  
2. It then asks each user for their **name** and **bid amount**.  
3. Each bid is stored inside a dictionary as `{name: price}`.  
4. After all bids are placed, the system automatically finds the **highest bidder** and declares the winner.

## 🧩 Example Run
⚖️ Welcome to the Silent Auction!

👤 What is your name? : Shubham
💰 What is your bid? : ₹500
📝 Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes

👤 What is your name? : Sourav
💰 What is your bid? : ₹650
📝 Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': no

🏆 The winner is Riya with a bid of ₹650!

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Functions:** For modular and reusable code  
- **Dictionaries:** To store and access bids efficiently  
- **Loops:** For continuous input until users finish bidding  
- **Conditionals:** For decision-making logic  
- **ASCII Art:** For creative console display
